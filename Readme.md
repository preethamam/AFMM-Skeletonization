# AFMM Skeletonization
"Skeletons and medial axes are of significant interest in many application areas such as object representation, flow visualization, path planning, medical visualization, computer vision, and computer animation. Skeletons provide a simple and compact representation of 2D or 3D shapes that preserves many of the topological and size characteristics of the original [1]." Skeletons are widely used in the crack width and length estimation problems. Skeleton extraction plays an important role in distinguishing the crack curvature and physcial properties in civil infrasturture maintenance. In this repository, two similar methods are implemented and presented in C, Python, Cython and Pybind:
